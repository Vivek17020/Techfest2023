# Currency Exchange Monitor & Alert Agent

## Overview

The Currency Exchange Monitor & Alert Agent is a Python-based application that allows users to monitor real-time currency exchange rates and receive alerts when the rates cross predefined thresholds. This project is built using the uAgent library and is designed to help users stay informed about currency exchange rate fluctuations.

## Features

- Real-time Currency Exchange Rate Monitoring: The agent connects to a currency exchange API to fetch real-time exchange rates, focusing on a specific base currency (e.g., USD).

- User-Defined Alert Thresholds: Users can specify currency pairs and set upper and lower thresholds for each pair. The agent continuously monitors exchange rates and triggers alerts when rates cross these thresholds.

- Notification System: The agent can send alerts or notifications to users when exchange rates meet or exceed the predefined thresholds. Currently, email notifications are supported, but other notification methods can be added as needed.
